### **Message to the Team**

Hi Team,  

Here’s the detailed breakdown of the **movie booking project** we’ll be working on. I’ve listed all the essential pages and components for both the user and admin UIs.  

To make development smoother, I propose that we first collaborate on Figma to create basic designs for these pages. These designs don’t need to be perfect—they just need to give us a clear idea of layouts and workflows. This will help us during the coding phase and ensure we stay on the same page.  

Additionally, learning Figma as a team can be a valuable skill for future jobs or projects, especially for understanding UI/UX workflows.

### **Movie Booking Project Overview**

We are building a **movie booking system** with separate user interfaces for regular users and theatre admins. Below is the proposed structure for both UIs, including necessary pages and components.

#### **User UI**
1. **Home Page (Index Page)**
   - Displays a welcome message and available movies as tiles or cards.  
   - Buttons for **Sign Up** and **Login** if the user isn’t logged in.  

2. **Sign Up / Login Page**  
   - Sign-up form (with Google Sign-In integration).  
   - Login form with options to continue with email/password or Google.  

3. **Logged-In Home Page**  
   - Personalized greeting (e.g., "Hi, [username]").  
   - Movie tiles/cards with movie titles, thumbnails, and basic details.  

4. **Movie Details Page**  
   - Detailed information about the selected movie:  
     - Director, stars, summary, genre, runtime, etc.  
     - Movie trailer (YouTube iframe or slideshow).  
   - **Buy Tickets** button at the bottom.  

5. **Seat Selection Page**  
   - Grid of available seats for the selected movie show.  
   - Ability to select multiple seats.  

6. **Checkout Page**  
   - Summary of selected seats, showtime, and movie name.  
   - Payment options (basic implementation or placeholder).  

7. **Wishlist Page (Optional)**  
   - Allows users to save movies they want to book later.  

8. **Google Sign-In Integration**  
   - Simplifies user login/signup.  



#### **Admin UI**
1. **Admin Login Page**
   - Login form for theatre admins with OTP verification.

   - Update, delete, or modify movie details.  

4. **Manage Shows Page**
